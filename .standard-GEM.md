standard-GEM v0.3
=================

For details about the [aims](), [scope](), and [use case]() of this standard see the [wiki pages of the `standard-GEM` repository](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/standard-GEM/wiki).

### Terminology
TODO copy from the original file

### Instructions
This document serves as a checklist for creating an open source genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) on GitHub.
It is recommended that this file is edited with [checkmarks](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists), and kept in the repository for reference. With further updates to `standard-GEM`, one should paste over the new version of this file.
Adherence to the standard is not linked to this file. Instead, the compliance status is visible at ... TODO


Repository creation
-------------------
- [ ] Navigate to [standard-GEM]() and click on 'Use as template'  
This will copy the contents of the _master_ branch into the new repository.

- [ ] Pick a repository name  
The name must be either a common name, KEGG organism, or taxonomy-derived short name, followed by the extension `-GEM` or `-GSMM`. The `-GEM` extension is preferred to ease pronunciation. The name can be prefixed by an abbreviation, eg `ec`, `sec`, `mito`, `pro`.  
Example: `ecYeast-GEM` TODO

- [ ] Pick a repository description  
The description must include the taxonomic classification in full.  
Example: `The consensus GEM for Saccharomyces cerevisiae`

- [ ] Add a repository URL  
The URL can be the _doi_

- [ ] Add repository tags
The tag `standard-GEM` must be added. Other tags like `genome-scale-models`, `systems-biology` can be added.  
Tags are not copied from `standard-GEM`, so they need to be added manually.


Repository workflow
-------------------
The GEM repository must have at least two branches: _master_ and _devel_. Commit messages must follow semantic commits adapted for GEMs (TODO reference).
A pull request to _master_ must be followed by a release, using the tag format `vX.X.X` where X are numbers, according to semantic versioning principles. The last field (“patch”) can also be used to indicate changes to the repository that do not actually change the GEM itself.  


For reproducibility, based on the `master` branch create a branch for each paper/presentation, following the format reproducibility/[paper] . It is recommended to also create a release from this branch, and refer to this branch and/or release, including in README.md. Having a release from this reproducibility/ branch ensures its backup on Zenodo.


File tree
---------
`./` signifies the root of the repository.  
`.keep` files are used to indicate that the empty folder should not be ignored by _git_.

- [ ] ./.gitignore  
This generic [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) was prepared for multiple programming languages.

- [ ] ./code  
This folder must contain all the code used in generating the model. It must also include a `README.md` file that describes how the folder is organized.


- [ ] ./data  
This folder must contain the data used in generating the model. It must also include a `README.md` file that describes how the folder is organized.

- [ ] ./modelFiles  
This folder must contain all the model files, in multiple formats, according to the guidelines below. As a general guideline, binary formats (`.mat`, `.xlsx`) must not exist on any other branches than _master_. Otherwise, with time, the size of the repository can create difficulties.  
All model files must be named the same as the repository without the postfix `-GEM`, and with the appropriate extension.  
Example: `yeast-GEM.mat`  
| Model file format | _master_ branch | _devel_ and other branches |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Matlab (.mat)     | should          | must not                   |
| sbtab (.tsv)      | can             | can                        |
| Text file (.txt)  | must            | can                        |
| Excel (.xlsx)     | must            | must not                   |
| SBML (.xml)       | must            | can                        |
| YAML (.yml)       | must            | can                        |

- [ ] Files for continuous integration testing  
The repository can be set up for continuous integration testing using memote with eg. Travis CI (.travis.yml), Jenkins (Jenkinsfile), GitHub Actions (TODO).

- [ ] _memote_ report  
The memote report should be present on the _master_ branch, in `.html` format.
